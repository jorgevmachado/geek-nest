- `Npm`

## Installing
    
```sh
git clone git@github.com:jorgevmachado/geek-nest
```

To setup the project, use the command

```sh
make setup
```
## Running

After configuring the host and completing the construction of the libraries, just run the command for each application to run locally.

```sh
make start # to run the application in development mode

make lint # to run the lint in the project

make unit-test # to run the tests in the project

make unit-test-cov # to run the tests in the project with coverage
```
